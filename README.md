## Topic Proposals

Have a topic you would like to propose for the next meeting? Great! Share it with us by posting a comment on the latest ["Topic Proposals" issue](https://github.com/Learn-by-doing/socratic-meetups/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+topic+proposals). This will let us plan the next meeting so that every speaker gets time to discuss their topic.

Example topics that we discussed at previous meetings:
* [schnorr](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Schnorr) - an alternative signature algorithm with several advantages over ECDSA
* [taproot](https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-taproot.mediawiki) - a proposal that focuses on improvements to privacy, efficiency, and flexibility of Bitcoin's smart contracts
* [BOLT](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/00-introduction.md) - the lightning network protocol specification
* [WhatsAt](https://github.com/joostjager/whatsat) - end-to-end encrypted, onion-routed, censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer instant messaging over Lightning
* [lnurl](https://github.com/btcontract/lnurl-rfc) - specification, latest implementations, wallet/app support

A few places to find inspiration for future topics:
* [bitcoin developer mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev)
* [bitcoin optech newsletter](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/)
* [lnd google group](https://groups.google.com/a/lightning.engineering/forum/#!forum/lnd)


## How to Run a Meeting

At a minimum, one person should prepare a topic to present during the meeting. The optimal number of presenters depends upon the length of the meeting and the depth of each topic to be discussed.

* __Prepare the room__:
	* Arrange seats (chairs/couches) in a circle
	* If there is a table, then everyone should be able to sit comfortably around it
	* The space should foster an environment of open discussion among all participants

* __Presentations of topics__:
	* Any attendee who has prepared a topic can present it and lead a discussion about it
	* Presenters should:
		* Ask the organizer if the topic is appropriate for the meetup; see [topic suggestions](#topic-suggestions)
		* Limit the topic presentation to between 5 and 10 minutes
	* Attendees:
		* Are encouraged to ask questions directly to the presenter after the presentation
	* The organizer should:
		* Guide the presenter and discussion (in case things go too far off topic)
		* Ensure each presenter has enough time to present and discuss their topic

* __Notes__:
	* The organizer and attendees are encouraged to take notes during each topic presentation
	* These notes should be added to this repository in the "meeting-notes" directory. Copy the [notes template file](https://github.com/Learn-by-doing/socratic-meetups/tree/master/meeting-notes/YYYY-MM-DD-template.md).
