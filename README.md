# Socratic Meetups

## How to Run a Meeting

At a minimum, one person should prepare a topic to present during the meeting. The optimal number of presenters depends upon the length of the meeting and the depth of each topic to be discussed.

* __Prepare the room__:
	* Arrange seats (chairs/couches) in a circle
	* If there is a table, then everyone should be able to sit comfortably around it
	* The space should foster an environment of open discussion among all participants

* __Presentations of topics__:
	* Any attendee who has prepared a topic can present it and lead a discussion about it
	* Presenters should:
		* Ask the organizer if the topic is appropriate for the meetup; see [topic suggestions](#topic-suggestions)
		* Limit the topic presentation to between 5 and 10 minutes
	* Attendees:
		* Are encouraged to ask questions directly to the presenter after the presentation
	* The organizer should:
		* Guide the presenter and discussion (in case things go too far off topic)
		* Ensure each presenter has enough time to present and discuss their topic

* _Notes?_ - should we take notes during each meetup?
