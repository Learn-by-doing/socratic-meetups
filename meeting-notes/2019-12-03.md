## Schnorr

* Current signature algorithm in bitcoin is ECDSA
* Wasn't used in original bitcoin implementation because it was patented, so there wasn't much tooling or libraries at the time (2008)
* Has advantages over ECDSA:
	* smaller signatures
	* can add signatures together (signature aggregation)
* Can be added via softfork
* Questions:
	* How does schnorr signature aggregation actually work?
	* Privacy benefits?


## Bitcoin Core latest release (0.19.1)

* bech32 addresses by default in GUI
* bip158: compact block filters (neutrino) instead of bloom filters
* 1000 commits, 100 contributors:
	*  what is in those commits?
