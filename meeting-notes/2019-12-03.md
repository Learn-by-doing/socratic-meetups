# Meeting Notes

_From December 3rd, 2019_

## lnurl

* is a side-channel communication mechanism
* is a network spec (flexible, non strict)
* addresses user experience issues

Merchant <-> NODE < - - - - - > NODE <-> Client

* is a BECH32 QR code
	* less info than LN invoice (hard to read for apps, too much data)
	* will make a request to some server
	* returns an invoice that customer app can pay
	* merchant can decide on scheme of the URL (example.com/tshirt/1234)

* SPEC:
	* open channels
	* return invoices
	* sign
	* authentication
	
* Possible application: **offline** ATM without being connected to a node (ie. decouple ATM from node)

* hopefully, these side-channel solutions would be integrated in BOLT, the LN spec.



## Schnorr

* Current signature algorithm in bitcoin is ECDSA
* Wasn't used in original bitcoin implementation because it was patented, so there wasn't much tooling or libraries at the time (2008)
* Has advantages over ECDSA:
	* smaller signatures
	* can add signatures together (signature aggregation)
* Can be added via softfork
* Questions:
	* How does schnorr signature aggregation actually work?
	* Privacy benefits?


## Bitcoin Core latest release (0.19.1)

* bech32 addresses by default in GUI
* bip158: compact block filters (neutrino) instead of bloom filters
* 1000 commits, 100 contributors:
	*  what is in those commits?
