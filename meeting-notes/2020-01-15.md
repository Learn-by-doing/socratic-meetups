# Meeting Notes

_From January 15th, 2020_

## META

* Create an issue for the next upcoming meeting. Participants can comment with topics that they would like to discuss.
	* Follow up to add the topics to the event on social/event platforms

## Soft forks: A technical but also political process

* Soft forks (NOT hard forks!)
* User activated vs. miner activated (soft fork) [[1]](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/uasf)
  * Big conflict in 2017 Re: Segwit UASF vs. Segwit2x/NYA Agreement [[2]](https://hackernoon.com/bip-148-uasf-first-year-anniversary-a-new-system-of-governance-223907ec298b)
* Goals for a "good" soft fork activation mechanism [[3]](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-January/017547.html):
	* Avoid activating in the face of significant, reasonable, and directed
objection
	* Avoid activating within a timeframe which does not make high
node-level-adoption likely
	* Minimize loss of hashpower due to miners being forked off the network
	* Use hashpower-enforcement to de-risk the upgrade process
	* Follow the will of the community (within reason!)
* Understanding the various incentives at play when upgrading bitcoin: Privacy, Economic, Political (e.g Power/Control)



## New release lnd (0.9.2) and Phoenix wallet

* lnd:
	* keysend - similar to lnurl-pay or spontaneous payments
* phoenix:
	* new wallet from ACINQ
	* focused on easier onboarding of new users
	* non-custodial - requires user to backup seed and set a PIN (after setup)
	* ACINQ LN node opens channel to user's Pheonix wallet (with inbound capacity)


## Trampoline Payments

* Work-in-progress BOLT proposal
* Payer sends payment to a "router" node that generates the route
* Payer doesn't need to store the network graph (useful for mobile apps)
* "Trampoline Onion Routing"
* Trampoline-supporting nodes are LN nodes but with extra functionality
* Already supported by Phoenix wallet?
