## Embedding data in Lightning Network payments

Recent protocol [changes](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/619) - specifically in [BOLT 04](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/04-onion-routing.md) - made it easier to append arbitrary data in payments on the Lightning Network. Specifically `hop_data` was deprecated in favor of the much more flexible `hop_payload`.

Pull requests have already been merged in all of the major node implementations:
* lnd:
  * ["Allow custom data fields in the htlc payload"](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/3670)
* eclair:
  * ["Variable-length onion payloads"](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/pull/976)
  * ["Activate support for variable-length onion"](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/pull/1087)
* c-lightning:
  * ["Variable hop payload size for sphinx"](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/2689)

So what is this used for now and can/will be used for in the future?
* [Multi-path payments](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-February/000993.html) - Splitting a lightning payment into multiple paths that sum to the desired total payment amount at the final receiver.
* [End-to-end, onion encrypted chat](https://github.com/joostjager/whatsat) - Proof of concept chat app based on Lightning Network named "WhatsAt".
